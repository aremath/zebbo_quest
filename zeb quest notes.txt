SM hack where you play as a Zeb

ASM work to do:
 - replace samus morph sprites with zeb
 - zero-gravity
 - lock samus in morph ball
 - Turn off morph things like bouncing?
	- or somehow don't use morph entirely...
 - edit in-game controls to change position instantly
	-> or update momentum to allow the rest of the game's physics engine / collision detection to work normally
		+ change "friction"
 - look at speed-booster code -> Implement speed booster with new movement controls!
 - figure out how to use multiple sprites for samus
 - Dying resets the room
	-> auto-saving?
 - How to spawn samus in the right state (use a door transition?)
 - Disable "landing" -> samus should always be interpreted to be in the air, even while hugging the ground
	-> or possibly just a new state for samus that doesn't do ground stuff...
 
 90#fECD5 - moving samus directly with the control pad....
 
Core mechanics:
 - flying around as a zeb
 - 1 energy -> OHKO mode
 - However, dying just resets the room (putting you in from the door you came in from)
 - No beam attack - no attack of any kind until you get speed
 - Item pickup order probably starts with speed booster, unless there are other ways to break blocks
	-> then varia, then gravity
 - Some way to make speed booster affect upwards motion too?
 - Escape sequence with rising acid
 - You're rescuing your children: you need to rescue a certain number of them to win
 
Ideas:
 - Varia / Gravity suit change your sprite futher --- (Zoa, Bull, Zeb, Zebbo, Gamet, Geega)
	- Gamet: Survive Heat
	- Zoa: Survive Water
	- Ripper: speed booster! (or Geega)
	- Bull: Shielded form??
	- Survive Lava?
	- Fireflea: Light the room!!!
	- Metaree: Drill through the floor!?
	
	- Your form determines what you get damaged by??
	
	- Ambitious: different forms that you switch between! (using select!?)
	- Super Ambitious!: start out as a geemer, gain other possible forms that move as they do in-game + have in-game invulnerabilities
		-> you are an X-parasite initially (puyo form)
		-> probably too much for an initial idea
		-> Kirby-style copy enemy form?
	- Ambitious: Your children follow you around, and you can't have more than X of them follow you at a time...
 - Ripper Quest?
 - Geemer Quest??
 - Snail Quest?
 - Beetom Quest??
 - Botwoon Quest!
 
Messages like "A new friend joins the team!" when you pick up the items that allow you to transform.
(Auto-equip the new friend as well)
- Don't display energy at all!
