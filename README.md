# zebbo_quest
Super Metroid ROMhack and Notes

This a hack (in progress) where you play as a Zebbo (and Zebbo's friends: Zoa, Zeb, Gamet, Geega, and Fireflea)

Someone has stolen your eggs, and it's your job to find them! Explore Zebes, and enlist the help of your friends to help you find your eggs.

As a tiny insect, the environment of Zebes can be scary. With no way to defend yourself, you must rely on your superior speed and mobility.
